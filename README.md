# The Community Firn Model - Lancaster Analysis Branch

This branch, created from the forked CFM repository, is used by the Lancaster University glaciology group as an example of running the CFM for specific case studies (e.g. examining elevation change over Greenland and comparing with altimetry records). The idea is that this branch contains only cleaned and working analysis code that could be of use to the group. For development code please create another branch. 

The CFM files in this branch should be kept up-to-date with the master branch, which in turn should be kept up-to-date with the upstream CFM repository.
